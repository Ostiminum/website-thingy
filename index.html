                <b>HAPPY TEACHER'S DAY PO, MA'AM!</b> As my Teacher's day gift for you po, I present you this website that I made just a night before the event (hehe). Anyway, hopefully you enjoy reading what I would about to share in the following texts.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the past year, Computer Science has been a very important subject for me. It has always been my favorite subject throughout Pisay, and was among, if not, only subject that I felt like I could see myself fitting in. However, I've only been able to appreciate it further back in summer of last year, when I decided to self-teach myself more about programming for a specific passion project I was working on. Little did I know, that decision would soon change how my life would go over the years.</p>
            <p>
                You see, at the time, I didn't have a full grasp of what I really want to do with my future. I didn't have a specific pool of activites or a selection of careers that I wanted to pursue in the following years. In other words, I was a bit unsure of what I really want to do with my life.</p>
            <p>
                That would soon change when I stumbled upon a challenge of manually updating a spreadsheet weekly for a ranking sheet for a game I was playing. At the time, I was fine with such a tedious task, but most of my friends convinced me to learn how to code in order to automate it just so I wouldn't waste two hours of my time every week. At first, I was a bit hesitant as I know it would take a lot of time, but later on, I would give in.</p>
            <p>
                Although not a relevant language for the task, I decided to pick up C#, mostly because of its general purpose. I would soon consume online courses in SoloLearn (it used to be good), watch tutorial videos in Youtube, as well as solving practice problems in SoloLearn, and later on in websites such as Exercism and CodeWars. After a while, I would learn the basics of the language beyond what I've learned in school at the time such as working with classes, certain iterables, exception handling, and a lot more.
            </p>
            <p>
                To cut the story short, these, as well as later events leading up to Grade 11, would make me be able to enjoy programming more and see it as a fun and interesting activity. It made me realize the amount of amazing things that you can do with just the tips of your fingers, a computer, and a sprinkle of creativity. And that what makes programming special to me. It was a way for me to bring my ideas to life, as well as being able to create cool stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                At that point, I was determined to pursue the path of becoming a developer. It felt like I found a new purpose in life. It was eye-opening. I've never once been this certain of my future. It sparked a new "me" inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, that newfound soul of mine was crushed when I shared it to some of my family members and relatives. They weren't so inclined on me pursuing such path, rendering it as a "waste of my skills and talent" and convincing me to take another path such as becoming an engineer and the likes. When I first hear it, it was definitely demotivating, especially after discovering a new side of me. And because of that, I thought. If I want them to know how certain I am with this, I would have to show it to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's where you come in into the picture. You were able to help me by giving me plenty of opportunities to explore. You allowed me to dwelve into competitive programming despite being so new to the scene. And because of that, my eyes were opened to a new world because of the training workshop held for NOI. It changed how I viewed not only on the beauty of how algorithms are designed, as well as allowing me to appreciate subjects that I used to really hate, like math. Those opportunities also allowed me to hold special memories on me. DISCS Pro serves as one of the defining parts of my life, and one that I would treasure for the rest of my life. And none of these would have been possible without you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for helping me in bringing me into the state of where I'm currently at now. My love for programming wouldn't be as strong as it is now without you, especially being interested in this so late in high school. Computer Science has now been my "comfort subject", in a sense that it allows me to be able to breathe from all the stress built up from other subjects and be able to go back to what I enjoy doing. And really, my life has never been the same ever since all of those stuff. I spent more time learning during the summer than playing games, which helped in shaping in a more productive version of myself. And I've been doing certain projects that hopefully I could finish when I get my hands on some free time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once again, I am very thankful for the stuff you have for me, and I hope you have an awesome Teacher's day!
